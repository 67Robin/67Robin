# Hi, I’m Robin KP

**Cybersecurity Analyst** • **Flutter Application Developer** • **CTF Developer** • **Polyglot Programmer**

I’m a security-focused developer with a strong background in **application security**, **mobile development**, and **competitive cybersecurity challenges**.  
I combine hands-on offensive security skills with production-grade development experience—building **secure mobile apps**, **cloud-connected systems**, and **research-driven CTF content**.

---

## 🎓 Background

- **Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA)**
- Cybersecurity Analyst specializing in threat modeling, incident response, and secure SDLC.
- Flutter Application Developer with cross-platform expertise and backend integration experience.
- CTF Developer crafting realistic, multi-stage challenges across **web**, **pwn**, **crypto**, **forensics**, and **mobile**.
- Programming languages: **Python**, **Java**, **Dart**, **C++**, **XAML**, **C**.

---

## 💼 What I Do

- **Application & Mobile Security**: Secure architecture reviews, code audits, dependency risk analysis (SCA), and mobile app hardening for Flutter/Android.
- **Offensive Security & CTF Engineering**: Design and deploy complex CTF challenges with chained exploits, protocol edge cases, and IR-driven storylines.
- **Flutter Engineering**: Scalable, testable apps with clean architecture (**BLoC/Provider/Riverpod**), secure storage, deep linking, CI/CD, and native interop (**MethodChannels/FFI**).
- **Backend & APIs**: JWT/OAuth2 auth flows, RBAC/ABAC models, OpenAPI-first design, rate limiting, and secure API gateways.
- **Systems & Tooling**: Custom Python/C++ security tooling, static/dynamic analysis workflows, fuzzing harnesses, and red-team automation.

## 🛡 Security Skill Set

- **Web Security**: SSRF, IDOR, deserialization, template injection, OAuth misconfig, race conditions, cache poisoning, HTTP smuggling, WAF evasion.
- **Mobile Security**: Flutter/Android reverse engineering, certificate pinning, secure key storage, dynamic hooking defenses, ProGuard/R8 hardening.
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: Container security (Docker), IaC validation, secrets management, least-privilege IAM, telemetry-driven threat detection.
- **Incident Response**: Log triage, IOC development, memory forensics workflows, containment runbooks.
- **Applied Cryptography**: Key management, misuse detection, side-channel awareness, CTF-grade crypto challenge design.

---

## 🛠 Development Stack

- **Languages**: Python, Java, Dart, C++, XAML, C
- **Mobile**: Flutter, Platform Channels, Native Android Interop
- **Security Tooling**: Custom Python/C++ utilities, fuzzers, SAST/DAST pipelines
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, quality gates, artifact signing, release pipelines
- **Testing**: Unit, widget, integration, golden tests; fuzz/property-based testing

---

## 🎯 CTF Design Philosophy

- Realistic attack chains reflecting modern enterprise environments with embedded detection signals.
- Multi-discipline: pivoting across web, binaries, network protocols, and mobile exploitation.
- Developer education: challenges that double as secure coding lessons with remediation guides.

---

## 📌 Selected Projects

- **Secure Flutter App Template** — Opinionated starter with auth, secure storage, offline-first sync, analytics opt-in, hardened networking.
- **CTF Challenge Packs** — Multi-stage challenges with IaC deployment and automated validation.
- **Security Tooling** — Scripts for automated recon, dependency auditing, and API fuzzing.

---

## 🔍 Research & Interests

- Threat modeling for mobile and API-heavy platforms.
- Advanced Flutter security: runtime integrity checks, anti-debugging, and network trust strategies.
- Modern exploit chains & detection bypasses informed by CTF and blue-team telemetry.
- Embedded security in audio/light-to-audio interfaces with ESP microcontrollers and LM358 circuits.

---

## 🛠 How I Work

- **Security by Design** — Integrate controls early, validate continuously, measure outcomes.
- **Code You Can Trust** — Clear abstractions, rigorous testing, minimal attack surface.
- **Pragmatic Tooling** — Build only what’s needed, automate what repeats, document for maintainers.

---

## 🤝 Let’s Build

I’m open to collaborating on:
- Secure, production-ready Flutter apps
- Advanced CTF challenges for conferences/training
- Security tooling, incident response automation, red-team utilities
